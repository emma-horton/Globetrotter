# Globetrotter - Key Indicators of Global Development

Submitted by ch376 and lsk5.

## How to run the Globetrotter visualisation:
Open index.html in a browser.
Follow the guidance in the visualisation (i.e., first choose an inital indicator, explore first dashboard, switch to second dashboard, follow link to external website or go back to first dashboard).

## Files and Directories
- images: background image
- raw_data: original data source files
- reformatted_data: reformatted data and python script for reformatting
- single_graph_files: isolated html files with graphs used for development
- sketching: tableau notebook and sheet 5 for development
- Example code: code examples for choropleth map, used for inspiration


## Testing
The solution was tested on the Firefox browser.

## Known bugs
Y-axis labels are partly hidden; dashboard 2 shows empty graphs if no data is available. Chosen indicators and years are set back to default when switching bewteen dashboards and/or indicators.
