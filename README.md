# Globetrotter 
An interactive dashboard developed to educate the general public on trends in global development across time. This visualision was based on the gap minder dataset The dataset spanned across 175 countries from the years 1800 to 2024, it contained both categorical and numerical data across 22,9336 datapoints.
## Purpose
This project was developed by two students as part of our coursework in the ‘Information Visualization’ module at the University of St Andrews. The web-based dashboard uses D3.js, HTML and CSS to build a reponsive and interactive platform.  
## Features
* Provides various views and dashboards for exploring global development data.
* Offers multiple filter options for detailed analysis.
* Enables selection of specific data points for in-depth exploration.
* Guides users to additional resources for further investigation.

## How to run the Globetrotter visualisation:
Open index.html in a browser.
Follow the guidance in the visualisation (i.e., first choose an inital indicator, explore first dashboard, switch to second dashboard, follow link to external website or go back to first dashboard).

## Files and Directories
Main files:
- relevant for use: index.html, connected to script.js and styles.css
- joint report pdf
- sketches pdf
Directories:
- images: background image
- raw_data: original data source files
- reformatted_data: reformatted data and python script for reformatting
- single_graph_files: isolated html files with graphs used for development
- sketching: tableau notebook and sheet 5 for development
- Example code: code examples for choropleth map, used for inspiration


## Testing
The solution was tested on the Firefox browser.

## Known bugs
Y-axis labels are partly hidden; dashboard 2 shows empty graphs if no data is available. Chosen indicators and years are set back to default when switching bewteen dashboards and/or indicators.
